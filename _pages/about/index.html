My background is in population health, geography, and data science (although I also studied journalism for three years). I am interested in “data science problems” along the environmental exposure pathway:</p> <ul> <li>Are there better ways to better predict or estimate an exposure?</li> <li>How should we model an exposure?</li> <li>What is the effect of the exposure?</li> <li>How do we translate this into public health practice and/or policy?</li> </ul> <p><strong>Research areas</strong><br> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Applications.</code> My main focus is on exposure science, or the study of human contact with environmental factors and the health effects of these exposures. Currently, I am studying mixtures of air pollutants and their effects on pregnancy outcomes. More broadly, I am interested in pollution, health and exposure inequities, and climate change.</p> <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Methods.</code> For my dissertation, I am using a combination of statistical and deep learning methods for estimating exposure and the effects of exposures. I am interested in methods for spatiotemporal analysis, as well as bias and missingness. Scalable computing is essential for a lot of my work. As an epidemiologist, I’m particularly interested in causal methods and interpretable machine learning — e.g., what is the effect of an exposure, and why does our model give us this result?</p> </body></html>
